More on the ‘git remote add origin url’ command

Using this command, you can add a new remote repository to your local repository. To do so, you should use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at. The git remote add command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin (it can be any name)

A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git (the address of the repository on your GitHub account that you want to link your local repository to.)
